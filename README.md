# imaging_new
New and improved code for analysing Ca2+ imaging data

The script "main_analysis" coordinates parameter input and calling of all other functions to conduct processing and analysis of calcium imaging data. 

Options include whether to carry out bleach-correction, plot baseline-adjusted and/or minmax normalised ratios.
There is also the option to carry out type 1 type 2 analysis as developed for AIY, as well as ON/OFF categorisation as developed for RIM and AIB.
